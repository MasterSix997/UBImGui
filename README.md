## Description
ImGui is just a simple integration between "Unity" and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), no extra features or any kind of bloat, so you can create your own features<br/>
Using the binds provided by [ImGui.Net](https://github.com/ImGuiNET/ImGui.NET) which in turn uses the binds from [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui)
